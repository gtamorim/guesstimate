<p>Thank you for completing our on-line guesstimate.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.5;text-align: justify;">The attachment you have received contains a copy of approximate prices for your computers, software and other hardware.</p>  

<p style="line-height: 1.5;text-align: justify;">We endeavour to give you the most accurate prices we can, but for the complete picture we would advise a site visit (at no cost to you) to assess and give you a more accurate monthly cost.</p>  

<p style="line-height: 1.5;text-align: justify;">To book an appointment, simply reply to this email with your contact details and convenient times and dates and we will call you. </p>  

<p style="line-height: 1.5;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t forget, there is absolutely no commitment on your side, if you don&#39;t like what we have to offer you can just walk away and we won&#39;t bother you again.</p>  

<p style="line-height: 1.5;text-align: justify;">By the way - we never pass on information to third parties such as email or names, we value your privacy just as we would value our own. </p>  

<p>We look forward to meeting you!</p>  
<br>

<p>Mark Maynard</p>
